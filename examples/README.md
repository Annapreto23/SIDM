# Examples

This directory contains demonstration scripts and examples of how to use the `sidm` package modules.

## Scripts

- `demo_solve_sidm.py`: Demonstrates solving the Jeans-Poisson equation for SIDM profiles given a CDM halo and baryon distribution.
- `demo_isothermal_series.py`: Solves for isothermal solutions over a time series.
- `compare_thresholds.py`: Compares gravothermal core-collapse thresholds across different parameters.
- `demo_phase_space.py`: A demonstration of phase space plotting and analysis.

## Usage
Run these scripts directly from this directory:
```bash
python demo_solve_sidm.py
```
They are configured to find the `sidm` package in `../src`.
